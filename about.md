I am a Bioinformatics undergraduate student at the [Lebanese American University](https://www.lau.edu.lb/) under The [U.S-MEPI Tomorrow's Leaders Scholarship Program](https://mepi.state.gov/leadership/tomorrows-leaders-program/tlu/).

Before joining LAU in the fall 2018 semester, I was a student at the [Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institut_de_g%C3%A9nie_%C3%A9lectrique_et_d%27%C3%A9lectronique) in Boumerdes, Algeria.
