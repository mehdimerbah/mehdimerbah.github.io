I am someone who is fascinated with data science applications in the biological field. I got my degree in Bioinformatics from the [Lebanese American University](https://www.lau.edu.lb/). 
I am mostly interested in Machine Learning/Deep Learning applications in the field and like to work on projects in this niche. It's always been a motivation of mine to keep up with the latest advancements of AI and what potential it holds for new discoveries when applied on complex challenges in Biology.  
Not the biggest bookworm, but I do enjoy reading. You can find my current and favourite readings in the readings page.   
Trying to get into the habbit of regular weblogging about issues and topics that interest me.
