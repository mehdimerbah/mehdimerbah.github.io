I am a Bioinformatics undergraduate student at the [Lebanese American University](https://www.lau.edu.lb/). I am mostly interested in Machine Learning applications in Functional and Computational Genomics and like to work on projects in this niche.   
Not the biggest bookworm, but I do enjoy reading. You can find my current and favourite readings in the readings page.   
Trying to get into the habbit of regular weblogging about issues and topics that interest me.
