# Mehdi Merbah

I am a Bioinformatics MSc student at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/) and co-founder of [pi_optimal](https://www.pi-optimal.com/), a startup building AI systems for marketing optimization.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **computational biology** and **machine learning**. I am particularly interested in:

- Topological Data Analysis applied to biological networks
- Gene regulatory network inference
- Reinforcement learning for decision-making systems
- Machine learning for drug discovery

Previously, I completed my BSc in Bioinformatics at the [Lebanese American University](https://www.lau.edu.lb/) as a U.S. MEPI Tomorrow's Leaders scholar. My undergraduate research focused on ML approaches for gene regulatory network modeling.
