# Mehdi Merbah

I am a Bioinformatics MSc student at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/) and ML Reasercher at [pi_optimal](https://www.pi-optimal.com/), a startup building AI systems for autonomous workflow optimization.

My interests lie at the intersection of **computational biology** and **machine learning**. I am particularly interested in:

- Gene regulatory network inference
- Single-cell data modeling
- Reinforcement learning in decision-making systems

Previously, I completed my BSc in Bioinformatics at the [Lebanese American University](https://www.lau.edu.lb/) as a U.S. MEPI Tomorrow's Leaders scholar. My undergraduate research focused on ML approaches for gene regulatory network modeling.
