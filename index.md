# Mehdi Merbah

I am a Bioinformatics MSc student at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/) and ML Researcher at [pi_optimal](https://www.pi-optimal.com/), a startup where we are building AI systems for autonomous workflow optimization.

My interests lie at the intersection of **computational biology** and **deep learning**. I am particularly interested in:

- Single-cell data modeling
- Reinforcement Learning in decision-making systems
- LLMs and AI systems engineering

## Background

I grew up in Algeria and started my university journey at the National Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, my journey in engineering was cut short, as I then moved to Lebanon on a U.S. Department of State scholarship to study Bioinformatics at the [Lebanese American University](https://www.lau.edu.lb/), where my interests focused on ML approaches for gene regulatory network modeling.

After graduating, I worked as a BI Engineer building data pipelines and ML models, before moving to Germany for my Masters. I joined Stellwerk3 as a Data Engineer, then along with my datascience team formed pi_optimal where I am currently working as an ML researcher/engineer trying to develop scalable AI solutions in different verticals.
