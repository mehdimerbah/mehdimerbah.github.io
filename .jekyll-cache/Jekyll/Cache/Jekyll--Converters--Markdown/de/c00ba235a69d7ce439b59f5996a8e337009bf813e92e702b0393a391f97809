I"î<p>I am a Bioinformatics undergraduate student at the <a href="https://www.lau.edu.lb/">Lebanese American University</a>. I am mostly interested in Machine Learning applications in Functional and Computational Genomics and like to work on projects in this niche. <br />
Not the biggest bookworm, but I do enjoy reading. You can find my current and favourite readings in the readings page. <br />
Trying to get into the habbit of regular weblogging about issues and topics that interest me.</p>
