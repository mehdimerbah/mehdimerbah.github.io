I"Ù<p>I am someone who is fascinated with data science applications in the biological field. I got my degree in Bioinformatics from the <a href="https://www.lau.edu.lb/">Lebanese American University</a>. 
I am mostly interested in Machine Learning/Deep Learning applications in the field and like to work on projects in this niche. Itâ€™s always been a motivation of mine to keep up with the latest advancements of AI and what potential it holds for new discoveries when applied on complex challenges in Biology.<br />
Not the biggest bookworm, but I do enjoy reading. You can find my current and favourite readings in the readings page. <br />
Trying to get into the habbit of regular weblogging about issues and topics that interest me.</p>
